                <h3>What is a Dinosaur?</h3>

                <p>
                    What is a dinosaur? While this is a simple question that can be answered with a simple answer, it doesn’t mean that it isn’t very fascinating. To learn exactly about these magnificent creatures you really have to go back over 231 million years ago. Back to a period of time known as the Triassic Period.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is when the first dinosaurs are believed to have appeared on the planet. They would then go on to rule the planet for over 165 million years. 
                    There were herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs. There were ones that walked on two legs and ones that walked on four. There were really small ones and really large ones. Dinosaurs of every shape and size. 
                     The word “dinosaur” means “terrible lizard” and one of the first things we’re taught about dinosaurs is that they aren’t lizards.
                </p>

                <p>
                   
                    After all, they were some of the most magnificent creatures ever to walk the planet.

                        Geologic Time Scale, also often known as GTS, is a method of determining when certain animals lived and their relationships to each other by examining rock layers and the fossils they contain. This method of sequential dating is used by not only paleontologists to determine when certain dinosaurs lived and how they may have lived but is also used by geologists and other Earth scientists in determining the date of the planet.

                    <p>
                        On this scale, time is broken down into smaller and smaller units with the largest unit being supereons. A supereon can then be broken down into eons. Eons can be broken down into Eras and Eras can be broken down into Periods, Epochs and Stages. Probably the best way of visualizing the GTS is to think of it in terms of a calendar. Condensed down on a normal calendar, a supereon would be a decade; an Eon would be a year, and an Era would be a month. Periods, Epochs and Stages (or Ages) would be weeks, days and hours, respectively.

                    <p>
                        The study of rocks to determine an Earth timeline (also known as Stratigraphy) goes all the way back to Ancient Greece. This is when the famous Greek philosopher Aristotle realized that the seashell fossils he found in some rocks near his home looked liked the same seashells he could find at his local beach. This prompted him to examine them closely and conclude that the fossils that he found must have come from animals that lived a long time ago. And from this astute observation, he was also able to conclude that both the land and the sea moved over time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although Aristotle was the first person to reason that fossils found in rocks were once living creatures, it wasn’t until the late 17th century that the principles of geological time scales were proposed by a Dutch scientist named Nicholas Steno. He proposed that over time, rock is laid down in successive layers known as strata and that this layer of rock paints a portrait of Earth’s timeline. He also concluded that the upper levels of strata must be “newer” rock and that layers below it must be older.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the theories of Nicholas Steno would eventually form the basis for the creation of the Geologic Time Scale, it wasn’t without its flaws. For instance, it didn’t take into account the fact that the rock layers could be altered over time. That they could become inverted after they’ve been deposited; that they might become tilted or that they may succumb to erosion. He also didn’t account for the fact that rock layers might have radically different appearances in different areas – even if they are laid down at the time. And probably the most important fact that Nicholas Steno failed to realize was that a rock layer represented only a small portion of the history of the Earth.

                    <p>
                        It wasn’t until the mid-18th century that these issues began to be addressed and a unified scale of time periods. One of the pioneers of this effort was a German geologist named Abraham Werner who divided the rock layers of the Earth’s crust into 4 separate types. These types were the Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and the Quaternary.  During the 19th century, other scientists contributed to the field. These included scientists such as Alexandre Brogniart, William Smith, and Georges Cuvier.

                        Before I begin listing some of the most popular periods of time in Earth’s history I would like to proffer somewhat of a disclaimer. This is not a complete list of all of the Eras, Periods, Epochs and Stages. For the purpose of brevity and clarity, I have only included the most popular and the most important ones of the prehistorical timeline. That’s not to say that there are unimportant periods in Earth’s history because all of them are important. I’m just saying some are more prominent than others. Which is why it pains me to have to decide which periods of time to include and which ones to leave out. But I did it in order to make this article more digestible to the average reader. Hopefully, I’ve made decisions that will improve the flow and readability of this text and have improved the quality of the content contain within. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing that I would like to add is that the estimates of the years of each era, period, epoch and stage are exactly that: estimates. While great measures have been undertaken to ensure the accuracy of these dates, you should be advised that the dates used may change from one part of this text to the next. That’s because most of the geological periods don’t have firm dates on which they are said to have started or ended but are merely estimates and can fluctuate by several million years. For instance, the Silurian Period is said to have started anywhere from 443 million to 440 million years ago and is said to have ended about 419 to 415 million years. Which is why sometimes a period of time might have one date one time and another one another time.  They may also fluctuate according to the scientist or simply from year to year as new information is unearthed. Which is why there may be some slight deviations from one part of this article, or site, concerning the dates on the timeline. However, I’ve tried to be as accurate as possible considering these circumstances.

                                    to be giving you a whole lot of different facts about fossils.
                                    So if you’re ready, let’s go explore the wonderful world of fossils!
                                    <br>
                                    One of the first questions I’m always asked is “just what 
                                    is a fossil.” And the answer to that question 
                                    is fairly simple. A fossil is the preserved remains of a plant, animal or insect that 
                                    lived a long time ago. It can be the actual preserved body of a creature that lived long ago, 
                                    or it can be merely signs that a creature lived long ago (like paw prints or old animal homes).
                                    <br>
                                    <span class="read-more-target">

                                        The next question that I’m usually asked is “how do minerals form.” 
                                        While this isn’t as easy as the first question, it still can be handled by 
                                        stating that fossils can be preserved in one of two ways. They can either be
                                        preserved without being changed—for example, being frozen or mummified—or 
                                        they can be preserved by being changed as is the case in the permineralization 
                                        of animals. Permineralization is when the creature’s body is replaced by carbon
                                        naturally.
                                        <br>
                                        The third question that I’m usually asked on this subject is “what are some interesting 
                                        fossil facts?” This is one of 
                                        my favorite questions to answer. That’s because 
                                        there are so many fun things about fossils to talk about. Everything 
                                        from the first fossils found to some of the interesting fossils found recently.

                                        One of my favorite facts about fossils is that they’ve been found by people for 
                                        thousands of years. As far back as ancient China people have been finding dinosaur
                                        bones and fossils. Many different types of dinosaur fossils were also found by the 
                                        Romans and the Greeks. Of course, they didn’t know at the time that they were finding 
                                        dinosaurs. No, they thought they were finding various kinds of monsters. Creatures they
                                        then built myths around. Instead of dinosaur bones they were seen as the bones of centaurs, 
                                        giants, dragons and other fantastical creatures.
                                        <br>
                                        Another fact about fossils is that they are millions of years older. 
                                        In fact, there are some that are really, really old. What is the oldest fossil ever found? 
                                        That would be a piece of blue-green algae that lived over 3 billion years ago! Now that’s an 
                                        old fossil.The largest fossil ever found was a petrified tree found in Thailand. 
                                        This tree was over 216 feet long. Scientists believe that when it was living it had to have 
                                        been at least 300 feet tall. That’s about the height of a three-story building.
                                        And that is all I have to say on fossils today. Hopefully I have answered all your 
                                        question on animal and dinosaur fossils. Fun facts that can be shared with your friends and family.

                                    on the ground and in the seas. Then they all mysteriously disappeared during one of

                                        <b>When Did The Dinosaurs Become Extinct?</b>
                                        <br>
                                        Around sixty-five million years ago, the dinosaurs became extinct. 
                                        At least, the dinosaurs that
                                        weren’t avian—or birds. This time, known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, 
                                        not only killed off the dinosaurs but also about seventy-five percent of all animal 
                                        and plant species that existed. This disastrous event not only closed out the 
                                        Cretaceous Period, but also marked the end of the Mesozoic Era. After the event, 
                                        the Cenozoic Era began. This is the Era that continues to this day and the one in 
                                        which we currently reside.

                                        <b>Why Did The Dinosaurs Become Extinct?</b>
                                        <br>
                                        While it isn’t exactly known what happened to the dinosaurs,
                                        there are a couple of hypotheses that scientists often postulate 
                                        to explain dinosaur extinction. One of the main theories—and the one 
                                        that has the most support among scientists—is that an asteroid struck 
                                        the Earth and caused the cataclysmic conditions that led to the death of 
                                        the dinosaurs. Another theory postulates that there was increased volcanic 
                                        activity that caused these adverse conditions. In either case, all of the debris that
                                        was put into the atmosphere, from either an asteroid strike or from increased volcanic
                                        activity, would have had enough of an effect to cause a situation known as a 
                                        “nuclear winter”. A nuclear winter is when so much debris is propelled into the 
                                        atmosphere, it forms clouds that block out the sun. This would prevent sunlight from 
                                        reaching the Earth’s surface, disrupting photosynthesis and causing the food chain to 
                                        eventually collapse.
                                        <br>
                                        Some scientists speculate that a 
                                        combination of these two events may have contributed to the downfall 
                                        of the dinosaurs. Increased volcanic activity may have destabilized the 
                                        environment and the asteroid just pushed it further over the brink. Other 
                                        scientists believe that changing climate may have contributed to the extinction 
                                        of the dinosaurs. We may never know precisely what caused dinosaur extinction, 
                                        but we do know one thing. It opened the door for mammals to fill the niche the 
                                        dinosaurs once occupied and eventually led to the rise of mankind.

                                    A question that is often frequently asked is “Where did dinosaurs live?”. 
                                    A simple answer to that question is that dinosaurs lived all over the Earth.
                                    They lived in North America, South America, Australia, Europe, Asia, Africa and even Antarctica.
                                    They lived on the ground, in the skies and in the seas. Just about every inhabitable corner of the planet 
                                    had dinosaurs.

                                    However, not all dinosaurs lived together at the same time or in the same 
                                    place. Today, we are going to go over some of the main dinosaurs from each of 
                                    the seven continents. That should not only answer the question where did 
                                    dinosaurs live, but is should also give you an idea of what dinosaurs had to 
                                    compete with each other.

                                        No, there weren’t dinosaurs trudging through the tons of snow.
                                        That’s because Antarctica was much warmer at the time and wasn’t 
                                        the snowy wasteland it is now. And as a result, it was able to host 
                                        quite a few dinosaurs. These include such fine specimens as Cryolophosaurus Ellioti, Antarctopelta Oliveroi, 
                                        Glacialisaurus Hammeri and Trinisaura Santamartaensis.

                                            As you can clearly see, dinosaurs were a diverse group of animals that made 
                                            their home on just about every part of the Earth. Billions of dinosaurs spread out all over 
                                            the world must have been a brilliant sight.

                   On Jan. 6, 2000, a wild mountain goat named Celia was a bucardo — a specific species of wild goat — and, crushed to death by a falling tree on the cliffs of the Spanish Pyrenees  
                    A group of Spanish scientists had taken a sample of Celia’s tissue, in the hopes of bringing her species back from extinction.
If it worked, notes science journalist Helen Pilcher in her new book “Bring Back the King: The New Science of De-extinction” (Bloomsbury Sigma), it “would mark a defining moment in the history of the Earth; an end to the finality of extinction.”
                   After two years, “cells with Celia’s DNA were injected into goat eggs that had been stripped of their own genetic material. After a brief electrical jolt, the eggs then began to divide.”
The embryos were implanted into the wombs of “surrogate mother goats,” and while most of the pregnancies failed, one did not.

                <p>
                   History was made on July 30, 2003, when one of Celia’s clones was born, marking the first time a species ever came back from extinction. Sadly, her health did not hold up. Her lungs had been “grossly deformed” and she died seven minutes later — marking the first time ever a species had gone extinct twice.
Many of us were introduced to the concept of “de-extinction” by the movie “Jurassic Park,” which resurrected the dinosaurs to horrific ends.
                    But the idea behind the film wasn’t the wild invention of a Hollywood screenwriter.
Pilcher writes that in the 1980s, John Tkach, founder of a “secretive cabal of scientists and clinicians in Bozeman, Montana” calling themselves the Extinct DNA Study Group, posed an intriguing thought experiment.

                   “What if, many millions of years ago, there had been a hungry mosquito that dined on a dinosaur then became trapped in amber, with its last supper still inside its stomach. If one could recover a dinosaur blood cell from inside that mosquito and then transplant it into an egg that had had its own DNA removed,” it might be possible to “grow a dinosaur.”
This theory might have been far-fetched, but it wasn’t totally crazy. Entomologist George Poinar from the University of California at Berkeley spent his career studying million-year-old insects preserved inside tree resin that had hardened into amber. Usually they were intact on the outside but the insides were “a disappointing mess,” but in 1980, he came across a fly that “defied expectation,” with cells still intact after 40 million years. This was exactly what Tkach had theorized about.

                <p>
                   Poinar’s findings, once published, excited the scientific community, including “a tall, gangly man” who visited his lab to ask questions about “bringing back life forms in amber.” Poinar thought nothing of it until years later, when he was informed that he’d been thanked in the back of a new book, soon to be a movie, called “Jurassic Park.” The book’s author, Michael Crichton, had been his tall, gangly visitor and “used [his visit] as the scientific basis for his novel.”
“Although dinosaurs were made of protein (and many other molecules besides), we can’t somehow rebuild one from a few scrappy bits of collagen. It’s like trying to construct the 5,195-piece Lego Star Wars Millennium Falcon from just a few bricks and the picture on the box,” Pilcher writes. “Without the instructions, it’s impossible to know what the other bricks should be or how to put them together.”

                <p>
                    Recently, using more advanced detection equipment, scientists have been able to confirm that the oldest DNA found to date belonged to a “700,000-year-old horse found frozen in the Canadian permafrost,” and that the oldest human DNA came from a “400,000-year-old hominin (an older species of human) found in an underground cave in Spain’s Atapuerca Mountains.”
The dinosaurs went extinct around 65 million years ago. So while a recently announced find of a 99-million-year-old dinosaur tail that included bones, soft tissue, and feathers, all cast in amber, was exciting for scientists studying the ancient animals, DNA breakdown means it won’t help resurrect them.

                    Still, Schweitzer believes that discovering dinosaur DNA one day might be possible. There are some scientists — including Schweitzer’s boss, Jack Horner, the scientific adviser for “Jurassic Park” and the inspiration for Sam Neill’s scientist character in the film — who wonder if it might be possible to resurrect dinosaurs in other ways.
“Horner believes he could make a dinosaur within as little as a decade without ever having to resort to ancient dinosaur DNA,” writes Pilcher. “All he has to do is make evolution run backwards.”
The first step of this scheme is to start with a modern descendant of the dinosaur. That is the easy part, as birds and alligators are the evolutionary descendants of the theropod, the category of two-legged dinosaur that includes the T. rex.
Horner’s notion involves taking an embryo of a modern bird and somehow culling out its ancient evolutionary characteristics, given that “sometimes living, modern creatures display distinctly ancient characteristics.”
Horner must find out what the instructions are and then discover a way of reactivating them, Pilcher writes.
“By tinkering with the development programs of embryonic chickens, he hopes to persuade them to bring out their inner dinosaur; to develop dinosaur-like features like teeth and tails.” In short, Horner is trying to hatch real-life chickens that are more dinosaur-like.

                   Even so, the odds of de-extincting the dinosaur are about as good as one showing up as your next Uber driver.
Scientists are currently trying to de-extinct species as diverse as the dodo, the passenger pigeon and the woolly mammoth but have hit road¬blocks including a lack of DNA, no proper incubation environment and the risk of cruelty to living related species that would need to serve as surrogates. (See sidebar.)
On a more positive note, Pilcher writes that the science of de-extinction may help prevent endangered species from going extinct in the first place.
“There are a number of projects out there where people are deliberately collecting cells from endangered animals, [including] collecting roadkill and taking cells from that,” says Pilcher. “We also have museums filled with all these stuffed animals, and while they don’t have living cells, very often they’ll have dead cells which have DNA.”
She notes, for example, that there are only three northern white rhino left in the world, which aren’t able to reproduce due to age and other factors.
Scientists have already taken skin cells from the rhinos in the hopes of one day converting the material first into stem cells, then into eggs that can be fertilized with semen samples, which they’ve also extracted.
According to Pilcher, it’s not inconceivable that scientists could breed a northern white rhino in a test-tube sometime in the next three to 10 years.
Meanwhile, if it’s dinosaurs you really want to see brought back to life, you’re better off marking your calendar for 2018, when the next “Jurassic Park” sequel is scheduled for release.
